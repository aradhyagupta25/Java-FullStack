In Java, the terms "Collection API," "Collection" (interface), and "Collections" (class) refer to distinct components of the Java Collections Framework (JCF).

1}. Collection (Interface)
The Collection (uppercase 'C') is a fundamental interface in the java.util package and serves as the root interface of the collections hierarchy.
Purpose: It defines the basic, standard operations that all collection objects should support, such as add(), remove(), contains(), size(), etc..
Role: It represents a group of individual objects (elements) as a single unit.
Implementations: It is implemented by various sub-interfaces like List, Set, and Queue, which in turn are implemented by concrete classes such as ArrayList, HashSet, and LinkedList.

2}. Collections (Utility Class)
Collections (uppercase 'C', plural 's') is a utility class in the java.util package.
Purpose: It provides a set of static helper methods for performing common operations and algorithms on collection objects.
Role: It acts as a toolbox to manipulate or operate on collections.
Methods: Its methods are all static and include sort(), min(), max(), reverse(), shuffle(), and methods to make collections thread-safe or immutable. You call these methods directly using the class name, for example: Collections.sort(myList);.

3}. Collection API / Collections Framework
The term "Collection API" or, more formally, the Java Collections Framework (JCF), is the overarching architecture or set of tools provided in Java for handling groups of objects.
Purpose: It's the entire framework of interfaces (like Collection, List, Set, Map), concrete implementation classes (like ArrayList, HashMap), and utility algorithms (in the Collections class).
Role: It provides a unified and standardized architecture for data structures, offering dynamic sizing, built-in methods, and efficient memory usage compared to traditional arrays.
