# Java Fullstack Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java Fullstack learning repository! This repo documents my daily progress, hands-on exercises, and mini-projects as I master the skills required for building robust fullstack web applications using Java and related technologies.

## 📚 Repository Structure

- `/backend/`: Core backend code (Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs)
- `/frontend/`: Frontend app code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- `/projects/`: End-to-end mini/fullstack projects combining backend and frontend
- `/notes/`: Key learnings, code snippets, and conceptual notes

## 🛠️ Skills & Topics Practiced

- Web & RESTful APIs (Spring Boot)
- Relational Databases (SQL, JDBC)
- Authentication & JWT
- Error Handling & Logging
- Frontend Basics (HTML, CSS, JS)
- React Fundamentals
- Connecting Frontend & Backend (API calls, state management)
- Project structure & best practices

## ⚡️ Daily Commitment

I push code and notes every day as part of my goal to master Java Fullstack development. Each commit reflects new concepts learned, coding challenges solved, or features added to ongoing projects.

## 🏗️ Projects and Progress

- Backend REST API demos
